# trickjump-module
Module for trickjump server on TigerGold59/TigerDyno

## How to use
Download this repository as a ZIP. Unzip, Change the name of the folder to `trickjump`, and drag into the `modules` folder in the TigerDyno main folder.
Add `"trickjump"` to the `use` parameter in `config.json`. If you are using this in a different server (not [the SMO Trickjumping Server](discord.gg/WYVZZF4)), then you will have
to change the whitelisted server ID in the module's `main.js`, change the mod commands channel ID in `cmds/tj_cmd.js`, and remove the section syncing the databases in `cmds/tj_cmd.js`.
